# Phase 3 Final Project – The Reading Tree Bookstore Management System

**Author:** Brian Kinyanjui Gathui  
**Email:** briankgathui@gmail.com

## Project Description
The Reading Tree Bookstore Management System is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application developed for "The Reading Tree," a small bookstore in Nairobi. This Python-based application utilizes SQLAlchemy for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and Alembic for database migrations, streamlining the management of book inventory, authors, and sales transactions. This project aims to enhance operational efficiency for "The Reading Tree" by providing a robust and user-friendly system for managing core business aspects.

## User Stories for the MVP

1. **Inventory Management**  
   As a store manager, I want to add new books (with details like title, author, genre, and price) so that the store’s inventory is always up-to-date and accurate.

2. **Book Search**  
   As a staff member, I want to search and view all books by author or genre so that I can quickly recommend titles to customers.

3. **Inventory Update**  
   As a manager, I want to delete or edit the details of a book (e.g., when the price changes or a book is out of stock) so that the store’s records reflect real-time availability and pricing.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Entity Management**:  
  - Manage publishers: Add, view, update, delete, and search publishers by name.  
  - Manage authors: Add, view, update, delete, and search authors by name.  
  - Manage books: Add, view, update, delete, and search books by ISBN.  
  - Manage warehouses: Add, view, update, delete, and search warehouses by code.  
  - Manage customers: Add, view, update, delete, and search customers by email.

- **User-Friendly CLI**:  
  - Intuitive and user-friendly CLI with clear prompts, input validation, and error handling for seamless data entry and retrieval.  
  - Utilizes color and ASCII art to enhance the user experience (optional based on preference).

- **Robust Database Management**:  
  - Well-structured relational database with at least six tables: Books, Authors, Publishers, Warehouses, Customers, and Transactions (depending on implementation).  
  - Leverages SQLAlchemy ORM for efficient data manipulation.  
  - Employs Alembic for database migrations, facilitating future database schema changes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Alembic for database migrations
- Pipenv for virtual environment and dependency management

## Project Setup, Intializations and Access

### Setup Instructions
#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

#### Set Up Environment

Install dependencies and activate the virtual environment using Pipenv. Run these commands in the root directory:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
#### Applying Alembic Migrations to Create Database Tables Using SQLAlchemy

These are the steps to apply Alembic migrations for creating database tables using SQLAlchemy. Each step is detailed to ensure no aspect is missed.

The sqlalchemy.url in your alembic.ini is set as a placeholder (driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname). Update this to point to your actual database URL:

```bash
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///bookstore.db
```

Generate the initial Alembic Migration, will execute the migration script and create the tables in the database (bookstore.db).
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration to create tables"
```

Run the migration to apply the schema to the database
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Reverting Migrations: If you need to undo a migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```


#### Database Seeding

Run the following commands in the root directory to initialize and seed the database:

```bash
python -m lib.db.seed
```
This creates and seeds a `bookstore.db` file in the root directory. You will see a confirmation message upon completion.

#### Run The Application

Start the CLI application by running the following command in the root directory:

```bash
python -m lib.cli
```
